Exio directly styles HTML elements like <button>, <input>, and <dialog>, allowing for easy DOM interactions and custom styles. Svelte directive bindings are also provided for convenience.",warning:"Exio is primarily intended for use in my own side projects, and it's not well-documented (any help is appreciated). The code is also not formally nor consistently maintained. The purpose of open-sourcing this repo is to provide contributors of projects using exio (i.e. YtcFilter) with a reference for how to use the library."},n={title:"Demo"},s={"view-source":"View Source Code"};var r={title:e,description:o,banner:i,about:t,demo:n,docs:s};export{t as about,i as banner,r as default,n as demo,o as description,s as docs,e as title};
