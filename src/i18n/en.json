    "title": "What is Exio?",
    "description": "Exio is a framework-agnostic UI library which extends native HTML elements. Exio directly styles HTML elements like <button>, <input>, and <dialog>, allowing for easy DOM interactions and custom styles. Svelte directive bindings are also provided for convenience.",
    "warning": "Exio is primarily intended for use in my own side projects, and it's not well-documented (any help is appreciated). The code is also not formally nor consistently maintained. The purpose of open-sourcing this repo is to provide contributors of projects using exio (i.e. YtcFilter) with a reference for how to use the library."
